### Shipment Price Prediction Project Setup Guide

**Project Name:** `shipment-price-prediction`

**Brief Description:**
The Shipment Price Prediction project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to transform the logistics and supply chain industry. This solution focuses on predicting shipment prices with exceptional accuracy, providing businesses with the tools to optimize transportation strategies, reduce costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.

#### üöÄ Getting Started

**1. Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   conda create --prefix venv python==3.8 -y
   conda activate venv/
   ```

**2. Install Requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**3. MongoDB Configuration:**
   - Dataset is sourced from `notebooks/data` and stored in MongoDB.
   - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
   - Set the `MONGO_DB_URL` environment variable in your system.
   - Data is stored in the database named `"shipmentdata"` and collection named `"ship"`.

**4. Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Built with

- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.
